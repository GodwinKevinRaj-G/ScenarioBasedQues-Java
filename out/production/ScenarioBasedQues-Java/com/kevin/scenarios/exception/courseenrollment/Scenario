 Scenario 2: Online Course Enrollment System (Polymorphism & Exception Handling)

 Problem Statement:

 You are building an online course enrollment system where students can enroll in courses.
 The system should: Allow students to enroll only if they are above 18 years old.

 If a student is below 18, throw an AgeRestrictionException.
 Implement a Student class with fields name, age, and enroll(String courseName).
 Demonstrate method overriding by having a PremiumStudent class that provides extra benefits in the enroll() method.

 Task:
 Create a Student class with necessary fields and methods.
 Create a PremiumStudent class that extends Student and overrides enroll().
 Implement the AgeRestrictionException class.
 Write a main method to simulate enrolling students of different ages.
